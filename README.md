# coding-start

## Overview
This repo aims to serve a series of pre-arrival contents as a self-learning session about the fundamentals of coding and softwares in the academic realm, for students in CCIR-Academy, particularly students currently majoring or in the near future in computer science and those taking a computational STEM course.

### Targeted Audience
- Students who have a relatively solid math background but don’t know anything about programming. 
- Students who know a bit about programming but don’t have formal education on the subjects 

## Session Design

### Session Goal

This course aims to help students with the following goals: 
- Get familiar with the basics of Python (e.g., syntax) 
- Acquire some knowledge on debugging
- Know where to search for answers
- Gain some hands-on experience (e.g., a mini-project that students can complete within 4-6 hours) 

### Session Coverage

This course aims to cover the following topics as suggested by our faculty members: 

- General introduction to Python. 
- Basic Python syntax and usage(e.g. `list`, `dictionary`, `for` and `while` loops, debugging)
- Fundamentals of setting up and using Jupyter Notebook (powered by `Google Colab`)
- Fundamentals of frequently imported third-party libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipyh` and `pandas`）
- Basic academic techniques that requires knowledge of coding or using certain softwares (e.g., data visualization, markdown writing, database)

### Session Structure

**Volume of Content**: We expect students spend `4 - 6 hours a week on the session for 2 weeks` or in other words `8 - 12 hours in total` as students should feel free to adjust their own pace.

**Learning Materials**: Materials are designed as units in relation to topics and distributed as `Google Colab Notebooks`. Each unit would contain:
  - Overall study guides (How to use these material)
  - Reading materials/videos or both. 
  - Step-by-step guided exercises
